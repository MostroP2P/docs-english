<p>Continue reading this documentation to understand what Mostro is, how it works, and how you can use it.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-mostro"><a class="header" href="#what-is-mostro">What is Mostro?</a></h1>
<p>Mostro is a peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin exchange platform on the Lightning Network for any local currency, operating on the <a href="https://nostr.com/">Nostr</a> protocol and not requiring Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures.</p>
<p>It uses <a href="./hold-invoice.html">hold invoices</a> as an escrow system to provide security for the exchange of sats, minimizing custody and reducing the trust needed in both the counterparty and Mostro.</p>
<p>By operating on <a href="https://nostr.com/">Nostr</a>, a communication protocol designed to be censorship-resistant due to the decentralization of its infrastructure, Mostro ensures that it is very difficult to block bitcoin exchanges, censor the posting of buy and sell offers, or hinder communication between users involved in an exchange. Additionally, as more <a href="https://github.com/MostroP2P/mostro">Mostro instances</a> become active, combined with Nostr's inherent decentralization, it will become increasingly difficult to stop P2P bitcoin exchanges without KYC.</p>
<h2 id="origin-of-mostro"><a class="header" href="#origin-of-mostro">Origin of Mostro</a></h2>
<p>Mostro is inspired by <a href="https://github.com/lnp2pBot/bot">@lnp2pBot</a>, a Telegram bot created in 2021 to facilitate bitcoin exchange via the Lightning Network without surrendering personal data, without custody of funds, and without KYC. The bot has grown steadily and organically, with global reach and a particularly significant impact in Latin America, where the population faces financial challenges and finds an alternative in bitcoin. It has also gained popularity in countries under authoritarian regimes, such as Cuba and Venezuela, where people use bitcoin to resist tyranny and reduce their dependence on local currency.</p>
<p>Although the <a href="https://github.com/lnp2pBot/bot">@lnp2pBot</a> operates efficiently, it functions on Telegram, a platform that, while offering many advantages, could potentially come under pressure from powerful governments seeking to pursue political dissidents or inconvenient public figures. In this context, <a href="https://nostr.com/">Nostr</a> emerges as an ideal alternative, allowing an exchange system like Mostro to operate without the risk of censorship by powerful entities, thus ensuring greater privacy and security for users.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-do-i-need-to-use-mostro"><a class="header" href="#what-do-i-need-to-use-mostro">What do I need to use Mostro?</a></h1>
<p>To use Mostro, all you need is a Lightning Network-compatible wallet.</p>
<p>You don't have to be an expert in <a href="https://nostr.com/">Nostr</a>. If you are, great! But if not, you can still use Mostro without any issues, as it is designed to be simple and intuitive for all users.</p>
<p>To perform bitcoin exchanges, you'll use a <a href="./clients.html">Mostro client</a>. Although each client has its own features, in most of them, you won't need to have a pre-created Nostr private key. To ensure the security and <a href="./privacy.html">privacy</a> of your transactions, the client should automatically generate a new private key each time you perform a bitcoin exchange, without the need for additional setup or interventions on your part.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="do-i-need-to-register-or-do-kyc"><a class="header" href="#do-i-need-to-register-or-do-kyc">Do I need to register or do KYC?</a></h1>
<p>NO! Bitcoin was born as "a peer-to-peer electronic cash system," and we are proud to support that principle. None of your personal data is required. Additionally, Mostro instances do not have access to conversations between users, so it is not possible to collect any personal information. You can find more information about how your privacy is protected on Mostro <a href="./privacy.html">here</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-does-mostro-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-mostro-work">How does Mostro work?</a></h1>
<p>To understand how Mostro works, it is important to know its components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/MostroP2P/mostro">Mostro daemon (Mostrod)</a>: Manages communication between users and the Lightning Network (LN) node. It publishes Nostr events, executes actions sent by users, and guides them through the exchange process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lightning Network node associated with the Mostrod instance: Creates and manages the <a href="./hold-invoice.html">hold invoices</a> that sellers must pay and makes payments for the invoices provided by buyers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="./clients.html">Mostro clients</a>: These are the applications that users interact with directly. They provide the communication interface between Mostrod and the users. The clients send Mostrod the actions performed by users, such as creating an order, opening a dispute, releasing sats, among others. They are also responsible for generating and handling users' private keys.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram summarizes how Mostrod, the seller (via a Mostro client), and the LN node interact:<br />
<img src="./assets/images/order-flow.png" alt="order-flow" /></p>
<h2 id="bitcoin-sale-flow-on-mostro"><a class="header" href="#bitcoin-sale-flow-on-mostro">Bitcoin Sale Flow on Mostro</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seller:</strong> Alice</li>
<li><strong>Buyer:</strong> Bob</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Order creation:</strong><br />
Alice accesses a <a href="./clients.html">Mostro client</a> and decides to post an order to sell 5000 sats for 3 USD, to receive payment on her XYZ card. The interface for creating the order will depend on the <a href="./clients.html">client</a> she uses. The order is posted in an order book that can be accessed from any Mostro client. If another user does not take the order within <a href="times.html">24 hours</a>, it will be automatically deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Order taken by the buyer:</strong><br />
Bob, interested in buying sats, accesses a <a href="./clients.html">Mostro client</a> (not necessarily the same one Alice used). He finds the offer of 5000 sats for 3 USD and decides to take it. He is then asked to provide an invoice for 5000 sats within <a href="times.html">15 minutes</a>. Bob generates the invoice in his LN wallet and sends it to Mostro, who instructs him to wait <a href="times.html">15 minutes</a> for his counterparty to respond.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Payment and communication between parties:</strong><br />
Alice receives a message from Mostro notifying her that someone has taken her offer and that she must pay a <a href="./hold-invoice.html">hold invoice</a> for 5000 sats within <a href="times.html">15 minutes</a>. If she does not make the payment, the order will be canceled. Once Alice pays the invoice, Mostro reveals Bobâ€™s public key to Alice and vice versa, allowing them to start a private chat. At this point, Alice must provide Bob with the number of her XYZ card to receive the fiat payment. When Bob sends her the 3 USD, he presses the <em>fiat sent</em> button in his Mostro client. Alice receives a notification to verify receipt of the fiat and then release the sats to Bob.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sats release:</strong><br />
When Alice confirms she received the 3 USD, she presses the <em>release</em> button in her Mostro client. Then Mostro will collect the 5000 sats from Alice's wallet and pay Bob's invoice. Finally, Mostro will ask both parties to rate their counterparty.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When Mostro connects both users, the time they have to complete the exchange is limited by the duration of the <a href="./hold-invoice.html">hold invoice</a> provided by the Mostro instance they are using. Users must respect this time frame; for more information, see <a href="times.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>If during the process, Alice and Bob decide not to proceed with the exchange, they can <a href="./cancelling-an-order.html">cancel</a> the order cooperatively. If either party attempts to cancel arbitrarily or defraud the other, the other party can open a <a href="./disputes.html">dispute</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In this example, it is assumed that Mostroâ€™s fees are 0. For more information on fees, see <a href="./fees-and-limits.html">Exchange Fees and Limits</a>.</p>

<h3 id="technical-explanation"><a class="header" href="#technical-explanation">Technical Explanation</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Alice creates the order:</strong><br />
When Alice creates the sale offer, her Mostro client should automatically generate a new Nostr private key that Alice will use only for that order (a new private key should always be generated for each order to protect usersâ€™ <a href="./privacy.html">privacy</a>). Using that key, Alice sends a <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/59.md">NIP-59</a> message to Mostrod with the order details. Then, Mostrod publishes an <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md#kinds">addressable event</a> of type 38383, with the order details and its status: <code>pending</code>. Mostro clients monitor these events and display those orders with <code>pending</code> status in their order books.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bob takes the order:</strong><br />
When Bob takes the order, his Mostro client automatically generates a new Nostr private key for this order, then sends a <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/59.md">NIP-59</a> message to Mostrod indicating that he has taken that offer. Mostrod publishes a new event 38383 for that order, this time with the status <code>waiting-buyer-invoice</code>, which removes the order from all clients' order books as it is no longer <code>pending</code>. Mostrod sends Bob a <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/59.md">NIP-59</a> message requesting an invoice for 5000 sats. Bob sends the invoice to Mostrod in a <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/59.md">NIP-59</a> message, and then Mostrod publishes an event 38383 for that order, this time with the status <code>waiting-payment</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alice pays the hold invoice:</strong><br />
Mostrod sends Alice a <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/59.md">NIP-59</a> message with the <a href="./hold-invoice.html">hold invoice</a> generated by the associated LN node. If Alice pays within the 15 minutes, Mostro sends her a <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/59.md">NIP-59</a> message revealing Bob's pubkey, and another message to Bob revealing Alice's pubkey. Additionally, it updates the event 38383 for this order with the status <code>active</code>. Now, Alice and Bob can communicate directly through encrypted messages using the <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/44.md">NIP-44</a> algorithm, and Mostrod does not receive any of those messages. When Bob makes the fiat payment and presses <em>fiat sent</em> in his client, he sends a <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/59.md">NIP-59</a> message with the <code>fiat-sent</code> action to Mostrod, who in turn sends a <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/59.md">NIP-59</a> message to Alice with that same action, and her client displays a <em>release</em> button to release the sats if she has received the payment. Mostrod also publishes an event 38383 for that order with the status <code>fiat-sent</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alice releases the sats:</strong><br />
When Alice presses the <em>release</em> button in her client, she sends a <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/59.md">NIP-59</a> message to Mostrod indicating that the sats should be released to Bob. Then, the LN node associated with that instance of Mostrod settles the payment of the <a href="./hold-invoice.html">hold invoice</a> and pays the invoice provided by Bob. At the end of the process, Mostrod publishes an event 38383 for that order with the status <code>success</code> and sends a <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/59.md">NIP-59</a> message to Alice and Bob, requesting that they rate their counterparty, who send back their rating through a <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/59.md">NIP-59</a> message.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For more details on the communication between Mostrod and its clients, you can read <a href="https://mostro.network/protocol/">here</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="accepted-currencies-and-payment-methods"><a class="header" href="#accepted-currencies-and-payment-methods">Accepted Currencies and Payment Methods</a></h1>
<p>Since Mostro is a peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange, it is technically available to anyone who wants to use it, as long as there is a counterparty interested in making the exchange. You can post or take offers in any currency and with any payment method.</p>
<p>Mostro uses <a href="https://yadio.io/">yadio.io</a> as a reference for currency prices, which allows the exchange of over 90 currencies listed on that platform. If your currency does not appear on <a href="https://yadio.io/">yadio.io</a>, you can request them to add it. However, if this is not possible, you can still use Mostro to exchange bitcoin; you'll just need to create an order by setting a fixed amount of sats in exchange for a fixed amount of your currency.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="exchange-fees-and-limits"><a class="header" href="#exchange-fees-and-limits">Exchange Fees and Limits</a></h1>
<p>Each operator of a Mostro instance can set their own fees and limits per transaction, fostering competition among Mostro instances and allowing users to select the one that best suits their needs.</p>
<p>The Mostro instance currently active on mainnet (<code>npub1ykvsmrmw2hk7jgxgy64zr8tfkx4nnjhq9eyfxdlg3caha3ph0skq6jr3z0</code>) charges a 0.3% fee to both the buyer and the seller for each transaction. Additionally, it allows exchanges ranging from 100 sats to 20000 sats per operation.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="can-i-cancel-an-order"><a class="header" href="#can-i-cancel-an-order">Can I cancel an order?</a></h1>
<p>If you created an order and it hasn't been taken yet, you can cancel it.</p>
<p>If the order has already been taken, or if you have taken an order and decide not to proceed, you will need to initiate a cooperative cancellation with your counterparty. If both parties agree, Mostro will cancel the <a href="./hold-invoice.html">hold invoice</a> paid by the seller, and the sats will be returned to them.</p>
<p>In case your counterparty does not want to cancel, you can initiate a <a href="./disputes.html">dispute</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hold-invoices-security-of-exchanges-on-mostro"><a class="header" href="#hold-invoices-security-of-exchanges-on-mostro">Hold Invoices: Security of Exchanges on Mostro</a></h1>
<p>Mostro uses hold invoices as an escrow mechanism to secure the funds of a transaction, protecting the buyer from potential fraud or non-payment. At the same time, it ensures the seller's security by not directly holding their funds.</p>
<p>To sell sats through Mostro, you must pay the hold invoice that will be provided to you. Hold invoices are a type of Lightning Network invoice that allows the "locking" of the sats you intend to sell in your wallet, without settling the payment until the transaction with your counterparty is completed. Depending on the wallet you use, you might see your payment as "queued", "frozen", "on flight", or "pending".</p>
<p>Once the seller of sats notifies Mostro that they have received the fiat, the hold invoice payment is automatically settled: the sats will be "unlocked" and collected by the Lightning Network node of the Mostro used for the exchange. Then, the corresponding <a href="./fees-and-limits.html">fee</a> will be deducted, and an attempt will be made to pay the invoice provided by the buyer immediately. If the payment fails, Mostro will request a new invoice to the buyer and repeat the process until the payment is completed successfully.</p>
<p>Mostro minimizes the custody time of users' funds, limiting it only to the period from when the hold invoice is collected from the seller until it is paid to the buyer, a process that can take only a few seconds.</p>
<p>The hold invoice payment may also be settled if users enter a <a href="./disputes.html">dispute</a> and the administrator determines that the sats should be transferred to the buyer. Conversely, if the administrator decides that the order should be canceled, the hold invoice payment will be canceled, and the sats will be "unlocked" in the seller's wallet, without ever leaving it. This will also occur if a cooperative <a href="./cancelling-an-order.html">cancellation</a> is made, or if the validity time of the hold invoice, which is limited, is exceeded.</p>
<p>The hold invoices generated by the Lightning Network node of the Mostro currently active on mainnet (<code>npub1ykvsmrmw2hk7jgxgy64zr8tfkx4nnjhq9eyfxdlg3caha3ph0skq6jr3z0</code>) have an approximate validity period of 24 hours.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="exchange-times"><a class="header" href="#exchange-times">Exchange Times</a></h1>
<p>Mostro is designed for bitcoin-to-fiat exchanges to be fast, so it is recommended to use instant fiat payment methods.</p>
<p>Each Mostro instance operator can set their own time frames for each step of the exchange, fostering competition among Mostro instances and allowing users to select the one that best fits their needs.</p>
<p>Below are the specific time frames for the Mostro instance currently active on mainnet (<code>npub1ykvsmrmw2hk7jgxgy64zr8tfkx4nnjhq9eyfxdlg3caha3ph0skq6jr3z0</code>). As more Mostro instances become available, this information should be accessible to users so they can choose their preferred one.</p>
<p>When an offer is posted, it remains in the order book for <em>23 hours</em>. If no one takes it within that time, it will be automatically deleted.</p>
<p>Once someone takes an offer, they have up to <em>15 minutes</em> to either pay the <a href="./hold-invoice.html">hold invoice</a> if they are the seller or provide an invoice if they are the buyer. If they do not complete their part within that time frame, the order will be automatically reposted. However, if they do, then the counterparty will have up to <em>15 minutes</em> to complete their corresponding action (either paying the hold invoice or providing an invoice, depending on their role in the exchange); if they fail to do so, the order will be canceled and not reposted.</p>
<p>After the seller pays the hold invoice and the buyer provides their invoice, they have until the expiration of the <a href="./hold-invoice.html">hold invoice</a> provided by Mostro to finalize the exchange. For the Mostro instance <code>npub1ykvsmrmw2hk7jgxgy64zr8tfkx4nnjhq9eyfxdlg3caha3ph0skq6jr3z0</code>, this period is approximately <em>24 hours</em>. During this time, the buyer must send the fiat payment, and the seller must release the sats upon confirming receipt of the fiat. If this time frame is exceeded, the order will expire, and the sats will be returned to the original wallet without Mostro being able to intervene. For this reason, it is recommended to only use instant fiat payment methods.</p>
<p>Within this validity period, users can successfully complete the exchange, <a href="./cancelling-an-order.html">cancel it</a> cooperatively, or open a <a href="./disputes.html">dispute</a>. After the <a href="./hold-invoice.html">hold invoice</a> expires, Mostro has no ability to intervene in that order.</p>
<p>If both participants in a transaction are online and use instant fiat payment methods, the transactions can be completed almost instantly.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="reputation-system"><a class="header" href="#reputation-system">Reputation System</a></h1>
<p>Upon successfully completing a purchase or sale of sats, Mostro will ask you to rate your counterparty, and your counterparty will also rate you. The reputation system uses a 5-star rating scale, where 1 star represents the lowest rating and 5 stars the highest, allowing you to evaluate the transaction experience.</p>
<p>Reputation in Mostro is calculated iteratively, combining the mean and standard deviation of ratings and successful transactions. This means that during your first transactions, even if you receive maximum ratings, your initial reputation will not be very high; instead, it will progressively increase as you accumulate more successful transactions with good evaluations.<br />
This calculation is based on: <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2148877/iterative-calculation-of-mean-and-standard-deviation">https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2148877/iterative-calculation-of-mean-and-standard-deviation</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dispute-management"><a class="header" href="#dispute-management">Dispute Management</a></h1>
<p>If your counterparty is unresponsive, you suspect a scam attempt, or a misunderstanding arises that you are unable to resolve, you can initiate a dispute.</p>
<p>When you start a dispute, you will be attended to by the administrator of the Mostro instance you are using, or by a person designated by that administrator (solver). Upon opening the dispute, Mostro will provide you with a unique token number, and your counterparty will receive a different one. Both tokens will be revealed to the administrator handling the dispute. When the administrator contacts you and your counterparty, they will tell you your token, allowing you to verify that they are the designated person and ensuring they are not an impostor.</p>
<p>There is no standard method for resolving disputes across all Mostro instances. Each administrator can decide how to manage disputes generated in their instance and what evidence to request from users to make the most appropriate decision.</p>
<p>When the administrator decides which user is in the right, they will have Mostro release the sats to the appropriate user. Administrators do not charge any extra fee for resolving disputes.</p>
<p>To understand how user privacy is handled in the event of a dispute, refer to <a href="./privacy.html">this section</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that disputes are not automatically opened in any case. The users involved must initiate them before the <a href="./hold-invoice.html">hold invoice</a> paid by the seller expires, so that the administrator has enough time to request evidence from both parties and make an appropriate decision, as time continues to run from when the order is accepted and does not stop when a dispute is opened. The administrator must resolve it before the time expires, so users should not wait too long to initiate it. You can read more about time frames <a href="./times.html">here</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="privacy-in-mostro"><a class="header" href="#privacy-in-mostro">Privacy in Mostro</a></h1>
<h2 id="user-communication-privacy-with-mostro"><a class="header" href="#user-communication-privacy-with-mostro">User Communication Privacy with Mostro</a></h2>
<p>Communication between Mostrod and users takes place through <a href="./clients.html">Mostro clients</a> using <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/59.md">NIP-59</a> events. Within these events, the content and the public key of the sender are encrypted with an ephemeral key, preventing the public revelation of the identity of those interacting with Mostro. To enhance privacy, Mostro clients automatically generate a new private key for users for each order they take or create. This way, when Mostro sends NIP-59 events to users, the generated event will display a public key that is used only for that operation, ensuring a new <code>"identity"</code> for each exchange and preventing buy and sell transactions from being linked to a single person.</p>
<p>Mostro clients will never share usersâ€™ private keys with a Mostro instance or its administrator under any circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="reputation-mode"><a class="header" href="#reputation-mode">Reputation Mode</a></h3>
<p>Mostro offers users the option to operate in a <code>reputation mode</code>. In this mode, users identify themselves to the Mostro instance they are using with a fixed public key that acts as a primary identifier, allowing that instance to associate a <a href="./reputation.html">reputation</a> with the user based on ratings received from their counterparts after completing transactions. Although this public key is known to that particular Mostro instance, it is not shared with other users or exposed publicly, thereby preserving individual privacy. In this mode, each new order continues to use ephemeral keys, protecting the details of each exchange from third parties.</p>
<h3 id="full-private-mode"><a class="header" href="#full-private-mode">Full Private Mode</a></h3>
<p>For users who prioritize privacy above all else, Mostro offers <code>full private mode</code>. In this mode, users do not send any fixed identifying key to the Mostro instance they use. Instead, each transaction exclusively uses ephemeral keys generated for that specific exchange. This means that the Mostro instance has no way to link orders from the same user, providing the highest level of anonymity. Thus, not even a Mostro instance can determine which transactions belong to the same person.</p>
<p>Since in <code>full private mode</code> there is no fixed key associated with the user, it is not possible to build or maintain a reputation. When someone in this mode creates a new order, their reputation will appear as 0, just as if they were a new user. However, for those who value absolute privacy over trust based on ratings, this mode is ideal.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-in-user-to-user-communication"><a class="header" href="#privacy-in-user-to-user-communication">Privacy in User-to-User Communication</a></h2>
<p>Communication between the buyer and seller during a transaction occurs directly from client to client through an end-to-end encrypted chat, integrated into the Mostro clients. This system uses a simplified version of NIP-59 to hide metadata from external observers, and messages are directed to a unique shared public key generated using advanced cryptography (<a href="https://mostro.network/protocol/chat.html#shared-key">Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman or ECDH</a>). This "shared master key" is known only to the buyer and seller, ensuring that neither the Mostro instance where they are transacting nor third parties can access the conversation content. Additionally, since each transaction generates new and unique keys, privacy remains intact even between transactions with the same counterparty.</p>
<p>In case of a <a href="./disputes.html">dispute</a>, this shared key provides an effective solution: either party can choose to voluntarily share it with the designated mediator. With it, the mediator can decrypt only the conversation of that specific transaction, accessing an immutable copy of the messages, which cannot be altered or deleted. This allows disputes to be resolved fairly and transparently, exposing any attempts at deception without compromising the default privacy of users and only revealing information when necessary and with consent.</p>

<p>To use Mostro, you need to access it through a specific client. Below, we will cover several of them, which will allow you to interact both with Mostrod and with your counterpart in an operation.</p>
<p>The available Mostro clients so far are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./mostro-mobile.html">Mostro mobile</a></strong> (operational in alpha): mobile application.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./mostro-cli.html">Mostro-cli</a></strong> (operational): command line client.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./mostrix.html">MostriX</a></strong> (in development): TUI client, which operates in the terminal with an enhanced appearance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each client has particular features, so users can choose which one to use according to their interests and switch between them when they consider it convenient. The clients are responsible for creating, storing, and managing their users' Nostr keys. To learn how clients handle user privacy, read <a href="./privacy.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Although some clients are already operational, they are under constant development, with new features being implemented, UX improvements, bug fixes, etc. You may encounter bugs; if this happens, please report them, your feedback is very important.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Two users using different Mostro clients can exchange sats; however, for direct communication between them, they must take into account what type of messages their respective clients accept. Clients must implement this <a href="https://mostro.network/protocol/chat.html">peer-to-peer chat</a> but if a client has not yet implemented it, its users will not be able to view messages sent from a client that has implemented it. Similarly, this could occur with other functionalities. Developers of each client make their best effort to update them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Mostro is a FOSS project, so anyone interested can create a client to interact with it. We encourage you to develop your own client or collaborate on the development of existing ones to enhance the experience of P2P Bitcoin exchanges without KYC on Nostr!</p>
<p>To learn more details about them, keep reading this documentation.</p>
